  Variables : Course 1, Course 2, Course 3, Course 4, Course 5
  
  Domains : Di ={Classroom A01,Classroom B01,Classroom C01}
  
  Constraints : Courses whose times are conflicted must have different classes.
  
  E.g. Course 3 â‰  Course 4
  
  course 1 = Classroom C01
  
  course 2 = Classroom B01 or course 2 = Classroom C01
  
  course 3 = Classroom A01 or course 3 = Classroom B01 or course 3 = Classroom C01
  
  course 4 = Classroom A01 or course 4 = Classroom B01 or course 4 = Classroom C01
  
  course 5 = Classroom B01 or course 5 = Classroom C01
